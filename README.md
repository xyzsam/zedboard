Zynq Zedboard Applications
==========================

This repository contains source code and scripts for a variety of applications
that can be run on the Zynq Zedboard, both on bare-metal and on Linux. Each
application contains an accelerator that was created using Vivado HLS. User
software demonstrates how to communicate with these custom peripherals.

More documentation coming later.
